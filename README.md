## How to use it

- Clone the repo.
- Once in the root directory, install dependencies with `npm install`.
- You'll need a IEX Cloud API token. Create a free [IEX Cloud](https://iexcloud.io/) account to get one.
- Replace the `TOKEN` const value `config.tsx`. This is required to query the IEXCloud API.
- Start the application with `npx parcel index.html`. If you have `parcel` installed globally you can just do `parcel index.html`.
- Have fun :)
